# Movies Recommendation System

This project implements a **content-based filtering** movies recommendation system. The system recommends movies by analyzing the content of movies that the user likes. It uses key features like genre, cast, director, and keywords to find other movies that are similar to the user's preferences.

## Overview

This recommender system uses **content-based filtering** to recommend movies. The system compares the features of movies (like genre, cast, director, and keywords) to identify movies similar to what the user has previously liked or shown interest in. It works without relying on user ratings but rather by understanding the **content** of the movies.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is from the [Kaggle TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata). It contains information about thousands of movies including metadata such as the movie title, genre, cast, director, and keywords.

Before building the recommender system, the data undergoes preprocessing:
- **Removal of duplicates and missing data**: Ensuring the dataset is clean and only the necessary features are retained.
- **Feature selection**: We retain features essential to creating the model such as `genre`, `cast`, `director`, `keywords`, and `overview`.

## System Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed to remove duplicates and missing values. Only the relevant features are kept for the recommendation model.
2. **Tag Creation**: For each movie, a tag is created by combining keywords such as genre, cast names, director names, and an overview of the movie.
3. **Text Preprocessing**: The tags are cleaned by removing stopwords and stemming the words using the `PorterStemmer` function from the `nltk` library. This reduces words like "loved", "loving", and "love" to their root form, "love".
4. **Vectorization**: The tags are then transformed into numeric vectors using the `CountVectorizer` method from `sklearn`. This allows the system to mathematically compare the movies.
5. **Cosine Similarity**: We calculate the **cosine similarity** between the vectors of all movies. This similarity score is stored in a similarity matrix.
6. **Recommendation Generation**: Given a movie selected by the user, the system identifies the top 5 most similar movies based on the highest cosine similarity scores from the matrix.

## Key Steps

### 1. Preprocessing
The dataset undergoes preprocessing where:
- Missing and duplicate entries are removed.
- Only key columns such as `genres`, `cast`, `crew`, `keywords`, and `overview` are retained.

### 2. Tag Generation
For each movie, a unique tag is generated by combining information from the key columns:
- **Genres**
- **Keywords**
- **Overview**
- **Cast**
- **Director**

### 3. Stemming and Vectorization
Stemming is applied to reduce words to their base form (e.g., "loving", "loved" become "love"). Then, `CountVectorizer` is used to convert text data into vectors, creating a numerical representation of the tags.

### 4. Cosine Similarity Matrix
A **cosine similarity matrix** is computed, storing similarity scores between every movie. This matrix enables the system to identify movies that are most similar to a given movie based on the content of the tags.

## How It Works

1. The user inputs a movie they are interested in.
2. The system fetches the corresponding vector from the similarity matrix.
3. The similarity scores between this movie and all other movies in the dataset are retrieved.
4. The system then sorts the movies based on their similarity scores and recommends the top 5 movies that have the highest cosine similarity to the input movie.

### Example:
If the user inputs "Avatar", the system will search the similarity matrix and return the top 5 movies that are most similar to "Avatar" based on their content.
